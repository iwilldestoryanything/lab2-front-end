        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
            I’m someone who enjoys spending time doing things that bring me both pleasure and growth. Whether it’s
            coding, reading books, or watching films and TV series, I always find joy in activities that engage my mind.
            I’m passionate about learning new things and continuously improving my skills, especially in [mention your
            field, e.g., web development, design, etc.]. Balancing work with leisure helps me stay motivated and
            creative, and I’m always excited to take on new challenges.
